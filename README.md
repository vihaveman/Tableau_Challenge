## Purpose
I used the Citibike data from 2018 to 2020 for Jersey City for this analysis. I used this period because it was the last year that Citibike provided data with users' information, such as age and gender. I feel it's important to understand your users' demographics to meet their needs. I broke the analysis into three dashboards analyzing users, stations and geographic locations. 

## Findings 
### Users' Analysis
Citibikes served 1,095,641 users from 2018 to 2020 between the ages of 21 to 73 years old. Almost 75% of users are male; however, it is worth noting that the number of male users has declined by 22.29% while female users increased by 12.55%. Users are customers (short-term) and subscribers (annual memberships), of whom 90% are yearly subscribers; the data showed that this is on a downward trend decreasing by 29.35 as opposed to customers, which increased by 492%. While the data didn’t provide the reason for these trends, they may be attributed to restrictions imposed during the COVID-19 pandemic. If this theory is true, it is worth noting; overall, users declined by less than 5% from 2018 to 2020. 
  
Most users utilize the Citibike services most of the week between 7 am to 9 am and 5 pm to 8 pm, corresponding to traditional “rush hours.” Tuesdays and Wednesdays are the busiest, while Sundays are less busy. 
  
Users enjoy this service from late spring to early fall (May to October); this makes sense as Jersey City can be cold and dangerous for bike riding in winter. 
  
Males users between 25 and 43 utilize this service the most. 

### Stations' Analysis
Citibikes have 61 start stations and 224 end stations in the Jersey City area, with Grove Street Path is the most popular start station, while Hamilton Park is the most used end station, and most trips are between these two stations. 

These stations provided 2,384 unique bikes during this period. Users spend 295,167 hours using these bikes from 2018 to 2020. 

### MAPS' Analysis
The start and stop maps illustrate the concentrations of the most frequently used stations in Jersey City, mainly in zip codes between 07302 and 07310. This concentration corresponds with the users and station analysis indicating that residents of Jersey City utilize the bicycle-sharing service extensively, wherever possible. 

## Conclusion

Jersey City residents between the ages of 21 to 76 utilize the Citibike program. Stations are busiest at 8 am at the start of the day and between 5 pm and 7 pm in the afternoons.
 
Next steps, Citibikes may want to do further analysis to understand and address why 25% of their users are women.
