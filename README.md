# Tableau_Challenge

## Purpose
I used the Citibike data from 2018 to 2020 for Jersey City for this analysis. I used this period because it was the last year that Citibike provided data with users' information, such as age and gender. I feel it's important to understand your users' demographics to meet their needs. I broke the analysis into three dashboards analyzing users, stations and geographic locations.
